# Architecture Decision Records

Use this folder to store ADRs referenced in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
Each ADR should:

1. Use the naming pattern `ADR-XXX-title.md`.
2. Summarize the context, decision, consequences, and review date.
3. Link back to the relevant issues or pull requests.

If you propose a new subsystem or change any cross-cutting behavior (audio
pipeline, LLM orchestrator, database schema, privacy policies), capture the
trade-offs here before writing code.
